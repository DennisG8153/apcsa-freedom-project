# APCSA Freedom Project
by Dennis Grigoryev

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about HUGO. The purpose of this blog is to show the development of my work throughout the course of the semester.

## Content
For my project, I am making an online consolidated wiki with Hugo. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Hugo in order to make said wiki page.

## Implications
Unity and simplicty are two things that are core to any community. Using my tool Hugo, I made a working webpage that logs and will continue to log the process of the Minecraft server I help to moderate during my free time. Using the information [here](https://lizardcraft.fandom.com/wiki/LizardCraft_Wiki), I successfully made a functioning home page and working links to a small part of the Fandom wiki page. I wanted to use it to create a more friendly and welcoming place to gather information without the hassle of all the technical terms that the orgininal has. It would promote a better community because people could explain to one another in simpler terms what a certain interaction does rather than give a lecture based on one little factor. This could also have a global effect since we are letting people freely access the work one person is coding but broken down in a way people who are not as good with the coding behind the plugins can understand. It could also create job opportunies where I can make base template website s an dsell them to willing people who want to create blogs for themselves or others.
