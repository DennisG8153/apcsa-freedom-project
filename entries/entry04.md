# Entry 4 
##### 3/21/22

While in my last entry I talked about the struggles of connecting my Hugo static website to GitHub pages, I used Google to figure out if there were any sort of guides or videos that would break down the process better into something I can follow more straightforwardly because I tend to be more of an audio/hands-on learner rather than a visual learner. Using a 10-minute video from a fellow developer Ryan Schachte, I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4) on YouTube to help me connect my static website to GitHub, even though it is the wrong file because I chose a different theme. While the website [linked here](https://sparkles1736.github.io/sparkles.1736.github.io/#) does work, it is drastically different from the images on my local end.

While the two websites appear different, they do have the same content, even though on the GitHub pages website, it causes a 404 Error.
