# Entry 2 - The Building of Website
##### 12/17/2021

## Starting with the Building...
Working with Hugo for the last month has been interesting to say the least. The process of installing of the program was fairly straightforward. Following the tutorial of instalation again [(click here for the link)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for the newest version of Hugo (which you can find [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)), I realized that just learning the processes by reading was not going to benefit me in the long run. For this blog entry, I started off with building the basics for my website that I would be making with Hugo. Continuing to follow through the process, I built the basis of my website with the command ```hugo new site lizardlegion.com```, which you can see below.
### Snipet of the Code
```C:\Hugo>cd Sites
C:\Hugo\Sites>hugo new site lizardlegion.com
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\Sites\lizardlegion.com.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```
In the past, I ran into some trouble running the executable programs and the binary because of my failure to properly read and take the time to understand what was happening. For the longest time, I tried running the Hugo binary and continuously gave me the message that I could not complie nor run the binary. Through the use of my skills, Googling and problem solving, I figured out that the files had to belong within your C: driver, else they would not run. I also learned that you need to run a certain command in your command prompt, `%PATH% pathName`. Not having that command and me not knowing I needed this vital command set back progress for a while because I was not able to run the commands necessary to set up my guide on the Minecraft server I help to moderate, LizardCraft [wiki here](https://lizardcraft.fandom.com/wiki/LizardCraft_Wiki). Being able to understand and solve the issue at hand, rather than giving up and leaving the project allowed me to continue the promise I made and work towards an active and working page that people can use to seek guidance and knowledge about the server.

## So What's Next?
I want to start on adding both content and working towards a theme of the website itself. While I could make the decisions very well on my own, I realize that the guide is not going to be a single person project. While I may be the one who is doing all the coding and the behind the scenes work, I still need the team I work with to help guide, support and make sure that it can be accessible to everyone. What I may understand may not be understandable to others and I have to acknowledge that as an informant. Over break I plan on working towards the outline of the website and learning how to make different pages using this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43707051/hugo-adding-more-pages-to-single-page-themes) here and expanding on the functionality of it.
