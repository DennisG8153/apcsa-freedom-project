##### May 31, 2022 - The Not So Final Hurrah

Presenting my project to both my class and the judges taught me a lot about what I need to do going forward. Giving my elevator pitch during the SEP expo made me realize that there was a lot I had with me conceptually and the functionality of the ideas I wanted, the usage was not entirely there. Working on my MVP and continuing to work on it has made me reflect a lot about the process getting there. The idea was well thought out, a page where I can have people learn about something they are an individual of made me motivated to do better. Going forward, I want to add the funcitionality and usability the website should have had at the beginning but make it more polished and function better. Using communication and the reflections of the people who did judge my work, I understand that I have to work towards my goal in smaller steps but I shouldn't be afarid to ask for help. The idea is still possible, it just will take more time that I can invest during the summer. Hugo is very strong at the things it is designed for like blogs and website templates. Communication was important to the beyond MVP portion of my project since it caused a lot more reflecting that I haven't originially done because I was discouraged to continue forward.
Even if I did not get the best of scores in the judges eyes, I can tell that people are inspired by my project through my presentations and may potentially want to learn more because of it. While Hugo is hard and does have a learning curve some may never get over, it is important to keep looking forward to move past the struggles. Dwelling on things that are negative about your project can only get people so far. Using communication and explaining what's going to happen moving forward really hones in the ideas you wanted to do with your Freedom Project.
